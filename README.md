# Max Downforce

## Overview

Max Downforce is a racing game programmed in Lua and LÃ–VE. The pseudo 3d style and gameplay is similar to the classic Pole Position.

The player completes the game by completing each of a number of laps within a time limit. This is made difficult by computer controlled racers that get in the way. The game uses a 320 \* 200 resolution which is scaled to a larger window or full screen.
