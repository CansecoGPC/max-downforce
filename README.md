# Max Downforce

## Overview

Max Downforce is a formula one racing game being programmed in Lua and LÃ–VE. The pseudo 3d style and gameplay is similar to the classic Pole Position and my own game Grand Prix.

## Planned features

The player races a fixed number of laps against computer controlled opponents, who are programmed to avoid other cars. Number of laps and position are displayed. In contrast to some other games of this style, off screen opponents do still exist and can return on screen. The player completes the game by completing all laps but if the player crashes it's game over. The game uses a 320 \* 200 resolution which is scaled to a larger window or full screen.
