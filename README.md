# max-downforce
Pseudo 3d racer written in Lua and LÖVE

This game is a work in progress. I write it to learn about Lua and LÖVE. The game uses the 320\*200 resolution, similar to that of the Commodore 64, displayed on a larger window or full screen. This game will use the same pseudo 3d technique as my other racing game Grand Prix which was written in Blitz Max.

Whereas Grand Prix is an arcade game that throws unlimited numbers of anonymous cars at you until you run out of time, Max Downforce, while still being an arcade game, will work with persistent opponents. Cars that move out of the screen are not actually gone but will reappear if you lap them or they lap you. The game will also use a fixed number of laps to be completed.
